- 👋 Hi, I’m @InahoAZ
- 👀 I’m interested in backend software development, i really enjoy problem solving and develop solutions trying to apply the best coding practices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js with Express, and all things related to backend like docker, message brokers, websockets, etc. I also did projects with other languages/frameworks like Python/Django and PHP/Symfony.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finance-related projects.
- 📫 You can reach me on Linkedn https://www.linkedin.com/in/santyvillar/
